# My Computing Systems Journey

## About the Project

Welcome to my journey of going back to the basics. Frustrated with not fully understanding certain computing concepts, I've set an ambitious goal for myself for 2024: **to develop my own computer from scratch and create at least two pieces of software for it**.

This project is more than just about building a computer; it's about deepening my understanding of the fundamental principles of computing and software development.

## Goals

- **Build a Computer from Scratch**: Assembling a computer from the ground up to gain a comprehensive understanding of its workings.
- **Develop Two Software Applications**: Design and implement at least two original software applications to run on the newly built computer.
- Be a better programmer and problem solver.

## Resources

- **Books**:
  - ["The Elements of Computing Systems" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. This book will serve as a guide and a primary resource throughout this project.](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0262539802/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- **Courses**:
  - ["Nand to Tetris" - This hands-on course complements the book and offers practical experience in building a modern computer system from the ground up.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/week/1)
  - [Khan Academy - Math](https://www.khanacademy.org/math)

## Running the Hardware Simulator

To run the hardware simulator from the project fold, run the following commands:

```bash
./resource/tools/HardwareSimulator.sh
```

To run the all the scripts from any where in the system, add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/<path/to/project>/resource/tools"
```

Now run the following command to refresh your terminal:

```bash
HardwareSimulator.sh
# or
CPUEmulator.sh
# Etc
```

You can run any of the scripts from any where in the system.

### Tools

To help visualize and understand the hardware logic gates, I'm using the following tools:

- [Hardware description langauge and Hardware simulator ONLINE](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/hdl-hardware-simulator)
- [Logic Gate Simulator](https://logic.ly/demo)
