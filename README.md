# My Computing Systems Journey

## About the Project
Welcome to my journey of going back to the basics. Frustrated with not fully understanding certain computing concepts, I've set an ambitious goal for myself for 2024: **to develop my own computer from scratch and create at least two pieces of software for it**.

This project is more than just about building a computer; it's about deepening my understanding of the fundamental principles of computing and software development.

## Goals
- **Build a Computer from Scratch**: Assembling a computer from the ground up to gain a comprehensive understanding of its workings.
- **Develop Two Software Applications**: Design and implement at least two original software applications to run on the newly built computer.

## Resources
- **Book**: "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. This book will serve as a guide and a primary resource throughout this project.
- **Course**: "Nand to Tetris" - This hands-on course complements the book and offers practical experience in building a modern computer system from the ground up.
